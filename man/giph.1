.SH DESCRIPTION
.B giph
is a screen recorder that records the desktop, a window or selection and encodes it into a gif file. It prints the encoded gif directly to standard output when omitting [\fIFILENAME\fR].
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.BI "giph -g " "300x200+600+200 ~/Videos/$(date +%s).png"
Records a 300x200 pixel (width x height) rectangle, that is shifted 600 pixel to the right and 200 pixel down from the top-left corner. The recording stops when either 
.B ctrl+c
is pressed, or the 
.BR "process group is interrupted" .
The encoded gif will be saved in your users Videos directory and has the current timestamp as a name. To send an interrupt signal to the process group, you can use:
.in +2
\(bu
.BI "kill -INT -" PID
.br
\(bu
.BI "killall -INT -g " giph
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Print help and exit.
.TP
.BR \-\-version
Print version and exit.
.TP
.BR \-v* ", " \-\-verbose ", " \-\-quiet
Defines how verbose giph will be. Omitting [\fIFILENAME\fR] will overwrite the verbosity to \fI-1\fR (quiet).  Use the following list to determine which option to use for each verbosity level:
.in +2
\(bu
.IB "-1 \fR(quiet)" " --quiet \fR - logs errors"
.br
\(bu
.IB " 0 \fR(normal) - like quiet, also displays interactive components"
.br
\(bu
.IB " 1 \fR(verbose)" " -v\fR, \fB--verbose" "\fR - like normal, also logs basic information about steps"
.br
\(bu
.IB " 2 \fR(very_verbose) " -vv "\fR - like verbose, also logs detailed information about steps"
.br
\(bu
.IB " 3 \fR(debug) " -vvv "\fR - like very_verbose, also shows background process output"
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-select
Uses slop to interactively select the desired region or window to record. This uses the
.B SLOP OPTIONS
described below.
.TP
.BR \-g ", " \-\-geometry " " \fIGEOMETRY
Sets the region to capture.
.TP
.BR \-w ", " \-\-window " " \fIINT
Sets the window id of the desired window to capture.
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\-interface " \fISTRING\fR (default: \fIcli\fR)"
Selects the user interface method that is used for countdown, timer and to stop the recording. The possible values are:
.in +2
\(bu
.IR cli ": uses the terminal as a user interface"
.br
\(bu
.IR zenity ": displays control-windows using zenity"
.TP
.BR \-e ", " \-\-encoder " \fISTRING\fR (default: \fIffmpeg\fR)"
Selects one of the following encoders uses to encode the gif:
.in +2
\(bu
.IR ffmpeg ": high quality gif encoder"
.br
\(bu
.IR gifski ": highest quality gif encoder, rather slow, uses \fBGIFSKI OPTIONS\fR described below"
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-delay " " \fIINT
Sets the time in seconds to wait before the recording starts.
.TP
.BR \-t ", " \-\-timer " " \fITIMEDURATION
Sets a fixed time to record. The format is a timeduration as described in the ffmpeg documentation (https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-utils.html#Time-duration). As an example, '10' would mean 10 seconds, '3:30' means 3 minutes and 30 seconds, '1:02:03' means 1 hour, 2 minutes and 3 seconds, and '5.5' means 5.5 seconds.
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-framerate " " \fIINT
Sets the desired framerate of the recorded gif. A higher framerate will result in a larger filesize.
.SH SLOP OPTIONS
When
.BR -s " or " --select
is used, slop will be used to get geometry information. Read
.B slop(1)
for more detailed information about slop options. The following options will be passed to slop if they are set:
.TP
.BR \-b ", " \-\-bordersize " \fIFLOAT\fR (default: \fI1\fR)"
Set the selection border thickness.
.TP
.BR \-p ", " \-\-padding " \fIFLOAT\fR (default: \fI0\fR)"
Set the selection padding. This can be negative.
.TP
.BR \-t ", " \-\-tolerance " \fIFLOAT\fR (default: \fI2\fR)"
Defines how far the mouse can move after clicking while still being considered a click.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-color " \fIFLOAT,FLOAT,FLOAT,FLOAT\fR (default: \fI0.5,0.5,0.5,1\fR)"
Set the selection color as RGB or ARGB.
.TP
.BR \-r ", " \-\-shader
Set a shader to be used.
.TP
.BR \-n ", " \-\-nodecorations " \fIINT\fR (default: \fI0\fR)"
.RI "Tries to select child windows. " 0 " is off, " 1 " tries to remove decorations, " 2 " aggressively tries to remove decorations."
.TP
.BR \-l ", " \-\-highlight
.RB "Highlight the selection rectangle. This uses the color provided in " -c " or " --color "."
.TP
.BR \-k ", " \-\-nokeyboard
Disable being able to cancel the selection using the keyboard.
.TP
.BR \-o ", " \-\-noopengl
Disable graphics acceleration.
.SH GIFSKI OPTIONS
When
.BR -e " or " --encoder
.I gifski
is used, gifski will be used as the gif encoder. The following options will be passed to gifski if they are set: 
.TP
.BR \-q ", " \-\-quality " \fIINT\fR (default: \fI80\fR)"
Set the quality from
.RI "Set the quality from " 1 " to " 100 ", where 1 is the lowest, and 100 the best quality."
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-fast
Makes the encoding 3 times faster. Results in 10% lower quality and a bigger filesize though.
